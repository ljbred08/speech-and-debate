| **Verbal Citation** | "The filibuster was not an accident of history. It provides the crucial protection of requiring significant legislation to earn broader support than a fleeting or slim majority. By guaranteeing that the minority can continue debate, the filibuster impels the majority to reach out and compromise. This process embodies the Senate's traditional role as the place where the heat of passion is cooled and the best, most enduring policy is found." - Thomas Jipping, Heritage Foundation constitutional scholar, "The Senate Filibuster: The Founders Intended It, the Senate Needs It, and the Nation Depends on It", 2021 |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Thomas Jipping, constitutional scholar at the Heritage Foundation, argues that the filibuster is a deliberate and essential feature of Senate design rather than an accident of history. He explains that the filibuster provides crucial protection by requiring significant legislation to earn broader support than a slim majority, guaranteeing that the minority can continue debate. According to Jipping, this process impels the majority to compromise and embodies the Senate's traditional role as a deliberative body where partisan passions are cooled and enduring policy is developed through consensus rather than narrow partisan advantage. |
| **Impact** | Lowering cloture to a simple majority would eliminate the filibuster's essential role in forcing compromise and maintaining the Senate's unique institutional character. Without the 60-vote threshold, the Senate would become little more than a smaller version of the House, losing its deliberative function and ability to require bipartisan cooperation. The filibuster serves as a critical check on government power and ensures additional representation for states in the federal system. Eliminating this protection would remove essential institutional safeguards that promote moderation and prevent rapid policy swings based on narrow majorities. |
