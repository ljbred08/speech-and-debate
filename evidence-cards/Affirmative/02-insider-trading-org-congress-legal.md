| **Tag Line** | Congress is largely exempt from insider trading laws that would jail corporate executives, creating a legal double standard |

| **Verbal Citation** | Ian from Insider Trading Organization writes that 'Insider trading for Congress sounds like a rigged game, and it kind of is. Most assume politicians play by the same rules as Wall Street. That's a sucker's bet. Congress gets a legal pass on insider trading that would land CEOs in jail.' Ian explains that 'Insider trading laws nail execs for trading on material nonpublic info. Think secret mergers or earnings bombs. Congress? They're largely exempt. Securities laws don't fully apply to them. Politicians hear market-moving info daily. Budget deals, policy shifts, or defense contracts spill in hearings. Trading on this isn't illegal for them. It's a loophole big enough to drive a tank through.' The author further states that 'The STOCK Act of 2012 tried to rein this in. It bans Congress from trading on confidential info from official duties. Sounds tough, right? It's more like a speed bump. The Act demands transparency. Members must report trades within 45 days via public filings. But enforcement's a joke. Violations rarely face real consequences.' Ian concludes by noting that 'Cases are rare. No member has been convicted of insider trading under the STOCK Act. The system is built to protect, not punish. They're untouchable, practically.' |
| **What the evidence says in context** | The Insider Trading Organization argues that Congress operates under a different set of rules than ordinary citizens when it comes to insider trading. While corporate executives face strict prosecution for trading on material nonpublic information, members of Congress have carved out legal exemptions for themselves. The STOCK Act of 2012 attempted to address this but has proven ineffective due to poor enforcement and numerous loopholes. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates the fundamental injustice of congressional insider trading, supporting arguments for comprehensive bans on congressional stock trading. The legal double standard creates an unfair advantage for lawmakers and undermines public trust in government. The lack of enforcement under the STOCK Act proves that current regulations are insufficient, requiring stronger legislative solutions like the TRUST in Congress Act. |
