| **Verbal Citation** | Representative Chip Roy stated that 'The American people should have faith that Congress is at work for the good of the country, not for their own bank accounts. For years I have been working to address the problem of stock trading in Congress, first introducing the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act with Rep. Abigail Spanberger back in 2020. Now that Abigail has retired, I am proud to reintroduce this critical and bipartisan legislation alongside my friend Rep. Magaziner (D-RI). We have a long road ahead to address this Congress, but we can and should fix the problem during this term. We have the will and the mandate of the American people to do this. Let's deliver.' Representative Seth Magaziner added that 'Trust in Congress is at an all time low, but we can strengthen the integrity of our government by ensuring Members of Congress are serving their constituents and not their stock portfolios. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan, commonsense bill with Representative Chip Roy to ban Members of Congress — and their families — from trading individual stocks, so that we can hold Washington accountable to the people it serves.' The press release explains that 'The Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust (TRUST) in Congress Act would require Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependents to place certain investment assets into a qualified blind trust while serving in office. That way, Representatives and Senators cannot leverage their power as public servants to line their pockets.' |
| **What the evidence says in context** | The TRUST in Congress Act is a bipartisan legislative solution that would require members of Congress and their families to place certain investments in qualified blind trusts. The bill has broad support from government accountability organizations across the political spectrum and numerous cosponsors from both parties, demonstrating that congressional trading reform is not a partisan issue but a good government reform with widespread backing. |
| **Impact** | This evidence shows that there is already legislative momentum for congressional trading bans through the TRUST in Congress Act. The bipartisan nature of the bill and endorsements from diverse accountability organizations demonstrate that reform is politically feasible and has broad public support. This counters arguments that such reforms are partisan or impractical, showing there are concrete, workable solutions ready for implementation. |
