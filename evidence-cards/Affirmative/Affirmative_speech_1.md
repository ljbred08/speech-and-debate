This year's resolution is, Resolved: The United States Federal government should significantly reform Congress. We need to do this for many reasons, but one of the reasons is exceptionally important. We need to ban Insider Stock Trading. 

According to Dara-Abasi Ita at Investopedia, updated April 10, 2025 [What Is Insider Trading and When Is It Legal?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insidertrading.asp), he says that:     
Insider trading is the buying or selling of a company's securities by individuals who possess material, nonpublic information about that company.

This is dangerous because it creates an unfair market and allows the congressman to take advantage of the regular people. It doesn't give everyday people a chance to make money in their **legal** investments. One way the government thought they could fix this was by passing the STOCK Act.  

According to Ian at Insider Trading, published April 19, 2025 [Why Is Insider Trading Legal for Congress? A Legal Double Standard](https://insider-trading.org/why-is-insider-trading-legal-for-congress/), he says,   
Proving insider trading is a beast, especially for Congress. The [SEC needs hard evidence](https://www.sec.gov/about/divisions-offices/division-enforcement/how-investigations-work) of material nonpublic info tied to a trade. Politicians’ info often comes from public or semi-public sources. Pinning it down is like catching smoke.  
Trades are traceable via STOCK Act filings. But linking them to a specific tip’s brutal. Was it a briefing, a lobbyist chat, or a news leak? Good luck unraveling that.  
Intent’s another hurdle. Prosecutors must show the politician knew the info was confidential and traded anyway. Most dodge this with “I didn’t know” excuses. It’s a legal fortress.  
Cases are rare. **No member has been convicted of insider trading under the STOCK Act**. The system is built to protect, not punish. They’re untouchable, practically.

Now you might be thinking, if nobody has been punished then how do you know there are people actually illegally stock-trading? Well, according to Maya Kornberg at the Brennan Center for Justice [Congressional Stock Trading, Explained | Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/congressional-stock-trading-explained) Published September 4, 2025, she said:  
Recent examples of these potential conflicts of interest abound. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle made beneficial stock trades during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead of economic recessions after receiving briefings and early nonpublic information about the dramatic changes in the economy.  
In September 2008, Republican Rep. Spencer Bachus of Alabama, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, [attended a private meeting](https://www.npr.org/2011/11/17/142472051/rep-bachus-defends-trades) with the treasury secretary and the chair of the Federal Reserve. The next day, he bought stocks betting that the markets would fall, and he profited when they did.   
This is just one person, there are many others illegally stock trading in Congress.  According to Dave Levinthal and Madison Hall from Business Insider [78 Members of Congress Caught Violating Law on Stock Trades \- Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-stock-act-violations-senate-house-trading-2021-9) published on Jan 3, 2023, they say. 

Insider and several other news organizations have identified 78 members of Congress who've recently failed to properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the [STOCK Act](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-act-congress-trading-stocks-investing-2022-3).

According to Claudia Deane at Pew [Americans' Deepening Mistrust of Institutions | The Pew Charitable Trusts](https://www.pew.org/en/trend/archive/fall-2024/americans-deepening-mistrust-of-institutions), published on October 17, 2024 she says:   
Congress has faced a growing decline in confidence. Around 7 in 10 Americans have an unfavorable view of Congress, an institution that has run in the red on this front for well over a decade. And a whopping 85% of Americans say they don’t think elected officials care what people like them think.    
So how do we fix this? Well, we need to pass the Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust (TRUST) act.   
According to an article published by the U.S. Representative Chip Roy [Rep. Roy reintroduces bill to prevent Members of Congress from trading stocks | Representative Chip Roy](https://roy.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-roy-reintroduces-bill-prevent-members-congress-trading-stocks), on January 14, 2025  he said: “The American people should have faith that Congress is at work for the good of the country, not for their own bank accounts.”  He goes on to say:  

Specifically, the TRUST in Congress Act would:

* Require all Members of Congress, and their spouses and dependent children, to put certain investment assets into a qualified blind trust within 180 days after the enactment of this legislation. New Members of Congress, and their spouses and dependent children, would be required to place covered investments into a qualified blind trust within 90 days of assuming office. Affected individuals can remove assets from the blind trust 180 days after the Member leaves Congress.  
* Require all Members to either 1\) certify to the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate that they have established a blind trust to include covered investments or 2\) certify to the Clerk or the Secretary that they do not own any covered investments. The status of these certifications would be made publicly available by the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate.  
* Define covered investments as the following: a security, commodity, future, or any comparable economic interest acquired through synthetic means such as the use of a derivative.  
* Clarify that the following do not qualify as covered investments for the purpose of this bill: a widely held investment fund (such as a mutual fund) or a U.S. Treasury bill, note, or bond. These investments would not have to be placed in a blind trust.

So in conclusion, the Stock Act has failed, so we need to pass the Trust Act. It will ban insider stock trading using qualified blind trusts which the Congressman will certify that they do not own any covered investments by using one of the two methods. Thank you\!
