| **Tag Line** | TRUST in Congress Act establishes comprehensive requirements for Members of Congress to place covered investments in qualified blind trusts within strict timelines |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | The TRUST in Congress Act states that 'Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, a Member of Congress and any spouse or dependent child of such Member shall place any covered investment owned by such Member, spouse, or dependent child into a qualified blind trust.' The legislation also requires that 'Not later than 90 days after the date an individual becomes a Member of Congress after the date of enactment of this Act, such individual and any spouse or dependent child of such individual shall place any covered investment owned by such individual, spouse, or dependent child into a qualified blind trust.' The Act defines 'covered investment' as 'investment in a security, a commodity, or a future, or any comparable economic interest acquired through synthetic means such as the use of a derivative,' but specifically excludes 'a widely held investment fund described in section 13104(f)(8) of title 5, United States Code; or a United States Treasury bill, note, or bond.' |
| **What the evidence says in context** | The TRUST in Congress Act is comprehensive legislation that mandates Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children to place certain investment assets in qualified blind trusts. The bill establishes clear timelines (180 days for current members, 90 days for new members), defines covered investments broadly while allowing for widely held funds and government securities, and includes accountability measures through public certification requirements. |
| **Impact** | This primary legislative source demonstrates that there is a concrete, detailed solution already proposed to address congressional insider trading. The TRUST Act provides specific legal mechanisms, timelines, and definitions that would effectively prevent conflicts of interest while allowing members to maintain diversified investments. This counters arguments that congressional trading reforms are vague or impractical. |
