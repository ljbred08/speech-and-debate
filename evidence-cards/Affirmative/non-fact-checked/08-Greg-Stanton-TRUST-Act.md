| **Tag Line** | Greg Stanton emphasizes bipartisan support for TRUST Act to ban congressional stock trading and restore integrity to government |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | Representative Greg Stanton stated that 'Americans need to know their elected leaders in Washington are making decisions based on what's best for our country, not their own stock portfolios.' He explained that 'Our common-sense, bipartisan legislation will put an end to corrupt insider trading and bring some transparency and integrity back to Congress.' Stanton joined '44 of his colleagues from both sides of the aisle in reintroducing the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act, a bill that would effectively ban Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks.' The press release explains that the TRUST Act 'would reduce opportunities for insider trading by requiring Members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children to either divest from individual stock holdings or move their investments into a qualified blind trust during their entire tenure in Congress. This will prevent Members of Congress from profiting off of their positions through their access to nonpublic information.' |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Representative Greg Stanton joined 44 bipartisan colleagues to reintroduce the TRUST in Congress Act, emphasizing that the legislation would prevent insider trading by requiring members and their families to move individual stock holdings into qualified blind trusts. The bill has broad support from both parties and numerous government accountability organizations across the political spectrum. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates the broad bipartisan coalition supporting congressional trading reform, countering arguments that such reforms are partisan or divisive. Stanton's emphasis on restoring integrity and transparency shows this is fundamentally a good government issue rather than a political one, making reform more politically feasible. |
