### __[July 24, 2014](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballotpedia:Calendar "Ballotpedia:Calendar")__

__By _[Sarah Rosier](mailto:editor@ballotpedia.org) and the [Congress team](mailto:editor@ballotpedia.org)___\
For the first time in history, the majority of America's elected officials in Washington, D.C. are millionaires.[\[1\]](#cite_note-millionaires-1)[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) At the same time, 50 percent of Americans cannot afford to spend $5,000 in an emergency.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)

The median American citizen[\[4\]](#cite_note-4) saw his or her [household net worth](https://ballotpedia.org/Personal_Gain_Index:_Household_net_worth_\(American_citizen\) "Personal Gain Index: Household net worth (American citizen)") _decrease_ from 2004 to 2012 by an annual rate of -0.94 percent, while [members of Congress](https://ballotpedia.org/Household_net_worth_\(Member_of_Congress\) "Household net worth (Member of Congress)") experienced a median annual _increase_ of 1.55 percent. Congress saw a total increase of $316.5 million in assets held by all members in the study.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)

This page is about __changes in net worth of U.S. Senators and Representatives__ during their time in office. The data goes from 2004 through 2012.

This is the first part of the [Personal Gain Index](https://ballotpedia.org/Personal_Gain_Index_\(U.S._Congress\) "Personal Gain Index (U.S. Congress)"). The [Personal Gain Index](https://ballotpedia.org/Personal_Gain_Index_\(U.S._Congress\) "Personal Gain Index (U.S. Congress)") is a two-part study that examines the extent to which members of the [U.S. Congress](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") have individually prospered during their tenure as public servants.

---

In this study, we look at __changes__ in net worth during an incumbent's time in office. This allows us to:

*   See which incumbents had the largest gains in net worth
*   Compare the gains in net worth experienced by congressional incumbents with what happened to the net worth of the people they represent.

For more detailed information on the actual net worth of members of Congress, rather than the growth of their net worth, please see: _[Net worth of United States Senators and Representatives](https://ballotpedia.org/Net_worth_of_United_States_Senators_and_Representatives "Net worth of United States Senators and Representatives")._

## Methodology and notes

*   *   _See also: [Personal Gain Index (U.S. Congress)](https://ballotpedia.org/Personal_Gain_Index_\(U.S._Congress\) "Personal Gain Index (U.S. Congress)")_

Researchers used data provided by _OpenSecrets.org_ to calculate the change in net worth of each congressional incumbent from either 2004 or the year he or she was first elected, if that year was after 2004.[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)

The tables and graphs on this page show some of the highlights of the study. The __change in net worth__ information has also been added to each of [Ballotpedia's profiles of the 535 congressional incumbents](https://ballotpedia.org/List_of_current_members_of_the_U.S._Congress "List of current members of the U.S. Congress"). The data also includes some former members, whose net worth would have been calculated at the end of their term in the [112th Congress](https://ballotpedia.org/112th_Congress "112th Congress"). The data used to calculate changes in net worth may include changes resulting from assets gained through marriage, inheritance, changes in family estates and/or trusts, changes in family business ownership and many other variables unrelated to a member's behavior in Congress. Because many members have been in office for longer than the eight years this study illustrates, the real change in net worth each member sees after initially taking office may be higher than the numbers in this data.

Some incumbents experienced a net loss in net worth. When this is the case, it is expressed with a negative percent.

### Congressional net worth

*   *   _See also: [Household net worth (Member of Congress)](https://ballotpedia.org/Household_net_worth_\(Member_of_Congress\) "Household net worth (Member of Congress)")_

Members of the [United States Congress](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") and candidates for Congress are required to file an annual __Personal Financial Disclosure__ (__PFD__) on or before May 15 of every year.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

This requirement also extends to candidates for federal office, senior congressional staff, nominees for executive branch positions, Cabinet members, the president and vice president and Supreme Court justices. This was set by the "Ethics in Government Act of 1978." Additionally, anyone who manages political campaign funds for a U.S. Senator must file.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

This study includes figures for the 113th Congress' freshman members because despite their terms beginning in 2012 they were required to filed the __PFD__ during their candidacy in 2011.

As a starting point, congressional financial disclosure forms use value ranges, rather than precise amounts, when reporting assets and liabilities. _OpenSecrets.org_ gathers this information to build a range of potential values. For instance, if three assets are listed at a value range of $1,001-$15,000, the total range of assets would be listed as a minimum of $3,003 (3 X $1,001) and a maximum value would be $45,000 (3 X $15,000). OpenSecrets combines all assets and liability to form a total potential range of values, and then provides an average value as the best guess of each individual's net worth.[\[9\]](#cite_note-methodology-9) The earliest average was then adjusted for inflation. This data affords constituents the ability to see the real increase (or decrease) of each member's net worth.

The disclosures required on the __PFD__ include:

*   Income[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)
*   Honoraria[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)
*   Assets[\[12\]](#cite_note-12)
*   Transactions[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)
*   Liabilities[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)
*   Positions[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)
*   Agreements[\[16\]](#cite_note-16)
*   Travel[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)
*   Gifts[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)

| “ | Note that the ethics law does not require filers to report property, including personal residences, that is not held for investment purposes and does not produce income. The STOCK Act requires that the terms of all mortgages, including those on non-income producing personal residences, be disclosed. Mortgages reported on properties that were not listed as assets were excluded from the wealth calculations, but are displayed on our profiles of the corresponding officials. Even though they weren't required to do so, some filers did list the value of their personal residences; when they did, we included the information in our totals and detailed listings. Filers are required to report detailed listings and values of holdings that underlie an account. They occasionally also report the combined value of the account, in which case the combined value is omitted from calculations.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)[\[20\]](#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-20) | ” |

### American citizen net worth

*   *   _See also: [Personal Gain Index: Household net worth (American citizen)](https://ballotpedia.org/Personal_Gain_Index:_Household_net_worth_\(American_citizen\) "Personal Gain Index: Household net worth (American citizen)")_

An "American Citizen" figure was calculated in order to allow us to compare the change in [household net worth](https://ballotpedia.org/Household_net_worth_\(Member_of_Congress\) "Household net worth (Member of Congress)") of a member of Congress to the changes in net worth over the same period experienced by the average citizen.

The Census Bureau, the source of the average citizen data, breaks down net worth into [wealth categories](https://ballotpedia.org/Household_net_worth_\(Member_of_Congress\) "Household net worth (Member of Congress)"). One of these categories is "equity in own home," but Ballotpedia did not factor the average citizen's home equity into this figure because the Congressional net worth does not require members to report property (including personal residences) that is not used for investment purposes.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

## Net worth increases

### Top 100

This chart shows the average yearly percentage change in net worth of the 100 congressional incumbents whose calculated net worth[\[22\]](#cite_note-22) divided by the number of years studied was the highest.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)

*   The average increase in net worth in the Top 100 was 114% per year.[\[24\]](#cite_note-pingree-24)
*   Of the "Top 100", 56 are Republicans, 43 are Democrats and one is an Independent.
    *   In total, the study looks at 320 Republicans, 296 Democrats and two Independents.

Rep. [Chellie Pingree](https://ballotpedia.org/Chellie_Pingree "Chellie Pingree")'s dramatic net worth increase is due to her marriage. Because of this, Ballotpedia removed Pingree when calculating the averages for this study, while continuing to list her in the chart.

The study is able to have figures for freshman members of the 113th Congress from 2011, despite their terms beginning in 2012, because they were required to file __Personal Finance Disclosure__ forms during their candidacies in 2011.

The Top 100 table includes a handful of politicians who left office during or after 2012.

## Average percentage increases

### Yearly average gains

As illustrated in the ["Top 100" chart above](https://ballotpedia.org/Changes_in_Net_Worth_of_U.S._Senators_and_Representatives_\(Personal_Gain_Index\)#Top_100 "Changes in Net Worth of U.S. Senators and Representatives (Personal Gain Index)"), the average yearly percentage gain was found by dividing each member's total net worth growth percentage by the number of years included in the calculation. For example, Sen. [John McCain](https://ballotpedia.org/John_McCain "John McCain") would have his net worth percentage divided by eight (2004-2012), since those are the years for which data is available for his net worth. For someone like Sen. [Ted Cruz](https://ballotpedia.org/Ted_Cruz "Ted Cruz"), however, his total net worth increase would be the _same_ as his average yearly net worth increase, since the only available data is the increase between 2011 and 2012.

__The average member saw his or her net worth increase by an average of 15.4 percent per year.__

[![PGI percentage6.jpg](https://ballotpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/thumb/5/5b/PGI_percentage6.jpg/190px-PGI_percentage6.jpg)](https://ballotpedia.org/Personal_Gain_Index_\(U.S._Congress\) "Personal Gain Index (U.S. Congress)")

PGI percentage6.jpg

For the purpose of our comparison to the median American citizen data below, the __median__ congressional increase was 1.55 percent per year.

#### Winner's Circle

When the members who lost money during this time period are removed from the calculation,[\[35\]](#cite_note-35) the growth in wealth among the "wealth gainers" stands out. If a member _gains_, expect the gain to be large.\
__The average yearly percentage increase for those members who increased their net worth was 43.6 percent.__

#### Millionaire's Club

Those in Congress who held assets above the median net worth of $1 million in 2012 also saw a hefty annual percentage increase.\
__Congressional millionaires had an average yearly percentage increase of 23.9 percent.__

### Total average gains

As compared to the yearly average gains, the total average gains percentage change looks at the total change between the first year data is available for each member[\[36\]](#cite_note-36) and the 2012 data. Although this data is harder to compare member-to-member because the starting year may be different, it still provides insight as to who experienced the most drastic total increases. The average change in net worth for the members in this study was _72.6 percent_.

## Congress compared to American citizens

*   *   _See also: [Personal Gain Index: Household net worth (American citizen)](https://ballotpedia.org/Personal_Gain_Index:_Household_net_worth_\(American_citizen\) "Personal Gain Index: Household net worth (American citizen)")_

This report compared _average_ and _median_ data, and in both cases the growth of congressional net worth significantly outpaced that of the American citizen.

Congressional net worth figures are a relatively small data set,[\[38\]](#cite_note-38) so Ballotpedia used _average_ percentage changes throughout the study (adjusted as needed for outliers)[\[39\]](#cite_note-39) to best illustrate the average growth of wealth of members of Congress. The data for American citizens is a large sampling of the population that includes many households on either end of the distribution (high or low wealth), so _median_ numbers were also included.

An _average_ value is calculated by adding all the observations and dividing by the number of observations. A _median_ is the middle value of a list.[\[40\]](#cite_note-40) The _median_ figure can be beneficial in circumstances, like this one, where the high net worth of the wealthiest Americans can skew the _average_. Both the average and median for congressional and American citizen net worth growth are provided below. For a direct comparison to each individual member's figures (as shown on his or her Ballotpedia profile), the yearly _median_ change will correspond with each member's average yearly change.

### Median figures

Between 2004-2012, the _median_ American household[\[41\]](#cite_note-citizen-41) saw an inflation-adjusted _decrease_ of assets from $18,990 in 2004[\[42\]](#cite_note-ohfour-42) to $17,557 in 2012. This was an inflation-adjusted annual percentage change of -0.94 from 2004 to 2012. Note that in order to have an apples-to-apples comparison between the household net worth of U.S. Congressmen and that of the American citizen, the value of equity in the citizen's personal residence was not taken into account in calculating the net worth of the average citizen, since the value of the personal residence of a Congressman is not included in their disclosure of their [household net worth](https://ballotpedia.org/Household_net_worth_\(Member_of_Congress\) "Household net worth (Member of Congress)").

### Average figures

Between 2004-2012, the _average_ American household[\[41\]](#cite_note-citizen-41) saw an inflation-adjusted slight _increase_ of assets from $204,957 in 2004[\[42\]](#cite_note-ohfour-42) to $264,963 in 2012. This was an inflation-adjusted annual percentage change of 3.7 percent from 2004 to 2012.

*   As stated in the _median_ section above, in order to have an apples-to-apples comparison between the household net worth of U.S. Congressmen and that of the American citizen, the value of equity in the citizen's personal residence was not taken into account in calculating the net worth of the average citizen, since the value of the personal residence of a Congressman is not included in their disclosure of their [household net worth](https://ballotpedia.org/Household_net_worth_\(Member_of_Congress\) "Household net worth (Member of Congress)").

## Freshman increases

A limitation to the data set is that the whole picture of wealth growth while in Congress is unavailable for those members who entered office prior to 2004.

For example, Sen. [John McCain](https://ballotpedia.org/John_McCain "John McCain"), who has been in Congress since 1982, shows a total net worth decrease of -74.5 percent during the period of 2004-2012. However, what the study is missing is how much he was worth in 1982 compared to 2012.

For this reason, Ballotpedia studied the freshmen members of both the [113th Congress](https://ballotpedia.org/113th_Congress "113th Congress") (which began in January 2012) and the [112th Congress](https://ballotpedia.org/112th_Congress "112th Congress") (which began in January 2010). Although the 2012 freshmen only saw moderate growth after one year in office, the growth for the 112th freshmen was staggering. One could say that the new retirement plan is to get elected and then re-elected (that is the key) to Congress and you will be set for life.

### 113th Congress freshmen

From 2011 to 2012, the average net worth change of a freshman member of the [113th Congress](https://ballotpedia.org/113th_United_States_Congress "113th United States Congress") in _one year_ was:

[![PGI percentage2.jpg](https://ballotpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/images/thumb/1/1b/PGI_percentage2.jpg/200px-PGI_percentage2.jpg)](https://ballotpedia.org/Personal_Gain_Index_\(U.S._Congress\) "Personal Gain Index (U.S. Congress)")

PGI percentage2.jpg

The study is able to have figures for freshman members of the 113th Congress from 2011, despite their terms beginning in 2012, because they were required to file __Personal Finance Disclosure__ forms during their candidacies in 2011.

#### The 2012 "Freshman 15"

The following 15 freshman senators and representatives of the 113th Congress saw their net worth increase the most out of their incoming class of new members:
