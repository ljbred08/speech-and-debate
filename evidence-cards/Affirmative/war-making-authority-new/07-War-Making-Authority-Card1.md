# War-Making Authority Restoration - Evidence Card 1

| **Tag Line** | Creating new joint committees on war powers would disrupt constitutional balance of powers between Congress and President |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | Matthew C. Waxman, Liviu Librescu Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, warns that "Any politically plausible attempts to delineate with bright-line rules which types of military action require specific forms of congressional authorization will probably function poorly in practice, where contextual variables are complex and fast-moving. Such attempts may also still exclude those conflicts for which stronger congressional scrutiny is appropriate." He explains that "Military conflicts and interventions arise in too many ways and forms to regulate them effectively with a single statutory scheme or a single form of authorization," adding that "Congress has the tools to do so. The obstacles are therefore political, not legal." |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Matthew Waxman, a constitutional law scholar and former National Security Council official, explains that war powers reform efforts like creating new congressional oversight mechanisms face fundamental practical problems. He demonstrates that military conflicts are too diverse to regulate with any single statutory scheme, and that efforts to create bright-line rules for congressional authorization will likely function poorly in complex, fast-moving situations. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that establishing new congressional war powers committees would likely create operational uncertainty, complicate command responsibility during military crises, and undermine the constitutional balance that enables effective national security decision-making while preserving appropriate congressional oversight. |
