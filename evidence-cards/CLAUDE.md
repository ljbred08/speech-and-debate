# Evidence Cards Collection

This folder contains debate evidence cards with both markdown source files and corresponding PDF versions for competitive policy debate research and competition.

## Folder Structure

### Evidence Cards (.md files)
- **Purpose**: Markdown source files containing structured evidence for debate
- **Structure**: Each file should follow the standard evidence card format with:
  - Tag lines summarizing main arguments
  - Verbal citations with substantial quotes
  - Context explaining source arguments
  - Impact analysis connecting evidence to positions
  - Complete bibliographic information for academic citation

### Printable Versions (.pdf files)
- **Purpose**: Formatted PDF versions ready for debate competition use
- **Generation**: Should be created using `mcp__Printer__markdown_to_pdf` for consistent formatting
- **Usage**: Intended for printing and evidence exchange in debate rounds
- **Naming**: Should use clear, descriptive naming (e.g., "01-topic-source.pdf")
- **Content**: Should be identical to the corresponding .md files; if not, notify the user and help figure out how to merge the differences and which version is accurate.

## Quality Standards

### Source Requirements

## File Organization

- **Naming Convention**: Use systematic numbering (01-, 02-, etc.) for easy organization
- **Consistent Structure**: All files follow the standard evidence card template
- **Paired Files**: Each markdown file has a corresponding PDF version
- **Version Control**: Changes should be committed to preserve research progress
