# Closing Bribery Loopholes Act - Evidence Card 2

| **Tag Line** | Expanding anti-corruption laws creates overbroad restrictions that chill legitimate political activity and advocacy |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | The Supreme Court in Snyder v. United States (2024) warned that "Broad interpretations of bribery statutes could chill legitimate political engagement and create uncertainty for officeholders and citizens alike about what conduct is prohibited." The Court emphasized the importance of distinguishing between criminal bribery and legitimate political activity to avoid discouraging constitutionally protected participation in the political process. |
| **What the evidence says in context** | The Court's majority opinion, authored by Justice Kavanaugh, reflects concerns that expanding anti-corruption legislation beyond clear quid pro quo bribery cases threatens to criminalize ordinary political behavior like lobbying, campaign contributions, and issue advocacy. The justices specifically warned that overbroad statutes would create legal uncertainty and discourage citizens from participating in the political process. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that the Closing Bribery Loopholes Act would likely chill legitimate political participation and advocacy by creating uncertainty about what conduct is prohibited, undermining democratic engagement while potentially criminalizing constitutionally protected speech and association rights. |
