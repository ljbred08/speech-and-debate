| **What the evidence says in context** | Proposals to ban Congress from increasing the debt limit face significant constitutional and economic objections. The 14th Amendment's Public Debt Clause states that "the validity of the public debt of the United States…shall not be questioned," suggesting Congress has a constitutional obligation to ensure the government can pay its obligations. Legal scholars argue that any law forcing default would violate this provision and disrupt the constitutional separation of powers by creating inherent contradictions between congressional spending authorizations and borrowing limits. The Treasury Department warns that inability to raise the debt ceiling would cause an unprecedented government default, triggering financial crisis and threatening economic stability. |
| **Impact** | Banning Congress from raising the debt ceiling would violate constitutional obligations under the 14th Amendment while threatening catastrophic economic consequences. Such a ban would force the government to default on legal obligations, potentially triggering another financial crisis that could threaten jobs and savings of everyday Americans. The economic impacts would include higher borrowing costs, plunging stock markets, and risk of recession, while also threatening the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency and undermining international confidence in U.S. creditworthiness. |
