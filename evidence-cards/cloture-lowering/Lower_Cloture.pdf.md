### What the evidence says in context  
Heritage Foundation legal scholar Thomas Jipping explains that the filibuster has deep historical and constitutional foundations. He argues that the filibuster was intentionally designed as part of the Senate's structure to ensure that significant legislation must earn broad support rather than passing with simple majority votes. Jipping traces the filibuster's origins to the Founders' intent for the Senate to serve as a stabilizing, deliberative body that would check the passions of the House. Extended debate, he contends, is an essential component of the constitutional system of checks and balances that limits government power and ensures more careful consideration of major policy changes.

### Impact  
Lowering the cloture threshold to a simple majority would eliminate a fundamental constitutional protection that has ensured stable governance for over two centuries. The filibuster forces bipartisan cooperation and prevents drastic policy swings based on temporary political passions. Without this protection, significant legislation could pass with minimal support, potentially undermining rights and institutions that depend on broad

consensus. The filibuster serves as a crucial check on government power, ensuring that major changes to law and policy must earn substantial support from across the political spectrum, protecting both minority rights and governmental stability.
