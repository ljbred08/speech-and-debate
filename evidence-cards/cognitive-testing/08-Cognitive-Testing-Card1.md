# Cognitive Testing for Congress - Evidence Card 1

| **Tag Line** | Mental fitness testing for elected officials violates constitutional qualifications and voter sovereignty |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | The Constitution Annotated, the official congressional interpretation of the Constitution, explains that "The Framers designed these minimal requirements to give people freedom to choose the person who would best represent their interests in Congress." The official analysis states that "The Supreme Court held in Powell v. McCormack and U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton that neither Congress nor the states... can add to the qualifications stipulated in the Constitution for membership in Congress." This principle applies to any attempt to impose cognitive or mental fitness tests on elected officials. |
| **What the evidence says in context** | The Constitution's Qualifications Clauses in Article I establish only three requirements for congressional service (age, citizenship, and residency), which the Supreme Court has ruled are exclusive. Any additional qualifications, including cognitive testing requirements, would violate this constitutional design and undermine voter sovereignty by restricting voters' ability to choose their representatives. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that cognitive testing requirements for members of Congress would be unconstitutional, violating both the Qualifications Clauses and fundamental principles of democratic self-governance, while setting a dangerous precedent for allowing unelected authorities to override electoral decisions. |
