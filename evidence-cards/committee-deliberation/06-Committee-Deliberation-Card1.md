# Committee Deliberation Enforcement - Evidence Card 1

| **Tag Line** | Mandatory consensus calendar enforcement would undermine committee expertise and deliberative process |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | The Congressional Institute, analyzing discharge procedures, warns that "A successful discharge petition is an embarrassment to the majority leadership as it circumvents the committee process that they control." The Institute explains that discharge is "an often threatened, but rarely successful, means of forcing legislation to the floor of the House of Representatives without going through a committee." The Institute further notes that "According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the 221 petitions in recent history only 22 have resulted in floor consideration of the measure," adding that "As the number of signatures approach 218, pressure mounts on the leadership to bring the bill to the floor on their own terms, thus maintaining some control over the outcome." |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Congressional scholars explain that discharge procedures and consensus calendar mechanisms bypass the essential committee functions of specialized study, expertise development, and detailed legislative examination. These procedures are considered extraordinary tools precisely because they sidestep the normal deliberative process designed to ensure thorough vetting and refinement of legislation. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that consensus calendar enforcement and automatic discharge procedures would undermine the committee system's expertise-building function, reduce legislative quality by bypassing detailed vetting, and potentially lead to poorly crafted laws that lack the technical scrutiny and amendment process that committees provide. |
