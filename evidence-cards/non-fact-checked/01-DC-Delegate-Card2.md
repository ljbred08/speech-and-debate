# D.C. Delegate Appointment - Evidence Card 2

| **Tag Line** | The Founders intentionally designed the federal district to remain outside state control to prevent undue influence over the federal government |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | James Madison, in Federalist No. 43, explained that "The indispensable necessity of compleat authority at the seat of Government carries its own evidence with it. It is a power exercised by every Legislature of the Union, I might say of the world, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings be interrupted, with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general Government, on the State comprehending the seat of the Government for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the Government, and dissatisfactory to the other members of the confederacy." |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Madison argues that the federal government needs complete authority over its seat of government to prevent state governments from having leverage over federal operations. He warns that if the capital were located within a state, that state could potentially interfere with federal proceedings or use its control over the capital area to influence national policy, which would undermine the independence of the federal government and create tensions among the states. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that granting D.C. voting representation would fundamentally alter the Founders' constitutional design for federal independence, potentially allowing local politics to interfere with essential government operations and compromising the separation between federal and state authority that protects national governance from regional manipulation. |
