# No Budget, No Pay Act - Evidence Card 2

| **Tag Line** | No Budget, No Pay creates disparate impacts along class and potentially racial lines, punishing non-wealthy legislators while wealthy members remain unaffected |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | Professor Vikram Amar of UC Davis Law explains that "withholding salary creates disparate impacts along class lines (independently wealthy legislators don't rely on their salary for living expenses anyway) and also perhaps (because class and race are correlated) racial lines. But no punishment/incentive-creation is perfect, and this legislative proposal is certainly in the American mainstream as concerns precision." |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Professor Amar points out that the No Budget, No Pay proposal would disproportionately affect legislators who rely on their congressional salaries for basic living expenses, while independently wealthy members would feel little to no financial pressure. Because wealth and race are correlated in American society, the policy could also have unintended racial disparities, making it an inequitable and potentially discriminatory enforcement mechanism. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that No Budget, No Pay would create an unfair system where only less wealthy legislators face real consequences, potentially discouraging qualified middle-class candidates from seeking office while allowing wealthy members to block budgets without personal impact, undermining both fairness and effective governance. |
