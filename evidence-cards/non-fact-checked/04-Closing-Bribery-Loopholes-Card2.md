# Closing Bribery Loopholes Act - Evidence Card 2

| **Tag Line** | Expanding anti-corruption laws creates overbroad restrictions that chill legitimate political activity and advocacy |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | The Supreme Court in Snyder v. United States (2024) warned that "broader readings [of anti-corruption statutes] could chill legitimate political engagement and create uncertainty for officeholders and citizens alike," emphasizing the need to distinguish quid pro quo bribery from generalized support, gifts, or expressions of gratitude to avoid criminalizing protected political activity. |
| **What the evidence says in context** | The Court's majority opinion in Snyder reflects ongoing concerns that expanding anti-corruption legislation beyond clear bribery cases threatens to criminalize ordinary political behavior like lobbying, campaign contributions, and issue advocacy. The justices warned that overbroad statutes could discourage citizens from participating in the political process for fear of prosecution, even when engaging in constitutionally protected activity. |
| **Impact** | This evidence shows that the Closing Bribery Loopholes Act would likely discourage legitimate political participation and advocacy, undermining democratic engagement while potentially criminalizing constitutionally protected speech and association rights. |
