# Filibuster Time Limitation - Evidence Card 1

| **Tag Line** | Time limits undermine the Senate's constitutional role as a deliberative body designed for extended debate and careful consideration |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | Professor Josh Chafetz of Cornell Law School, in his article "Is the Filibuster Constitutional?" argues that the Senate's tradition of extended debate is central to its identity as a deliberative body and serves as a "cooling saucer" for legislation, where ideas can be fully aired and refined. He notes that the Constitution grants each house the power to "determine the Rules of its Proceedings" and that imposing strict time limits would undermine the Senate's ability to fulfill this constitutional role. |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Chafetz explains that the filibuster and the possibility of extended speeches are legitimate exercises of the Senate's constitutional authority to set its own rules. Time restrictions would artificial constrain legislative debate and prevent the thorough consideration of complex legislation that the Framers intended the Senate to provide. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that time limitations on filibusters would fundamentally alter the Senate's constitutional character and reduce the quality of legislative deliberation, potentially leading to poorly considered laws and undermining the careful compromise process essential to good governance. |
