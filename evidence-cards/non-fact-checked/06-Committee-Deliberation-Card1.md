# Committee Deliberation Enforcement - Evidence Card 1

| **Tag Line** | Mandatory consensus calendar enforcement would undermine committee expertise and deliberative process |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | The Congressional Research Service explains that "the committee system is designed to allow for specialized study and expertise in particular policy areas, and requiring automatic discharge of bills from committee would undermine this important function. Committees serve as workshops where legislation can be carefully examined, amended, and improved before consideration by the full chamber." |
| **What the evidence says in context** | CRS analysis shows that committees provide essential expertise and deliberative functions that cannot be replicated on the chamber floor. Forcing automatic discharge would eliminate the committee's role as a filter and refining mechanism for legislation, potentially leading to poorly vetted bills reaching the full chamber for consideration. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that consensus calendar enforcement would reduce the quality of legislation by bypassing committee expertise and deliberation, potentially leading to poorly crafted laws and undermining the legislative process designed to ensure thorough consideration of complex policy issues. |
