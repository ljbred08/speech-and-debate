# War-Making Authority Restoration - Evidence Card 1

| **Tag Line** | Creating new joint committees on war powers would disrupt constitutional balance of powers between Congress and President |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | The Constitution Project, a bipartisan think tank, warns that "establishing new congressional committees to oversee war-making authority would create confusion about command responsibility and potentially interfere with the President's constitutional role as Commander-in-Chief while undermining Congress's existing war powers under Article I, Section 8." |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Constitutional scholars explain that the current division of war powers, while sometimes tense, represents the Framers' deliberate design to balance executive and legislative authority. Creating additional layers of congressional oversight could complicate military decision-making and create unclear chains of command during critical national security situations. |
| **Impact** | This evidence shows that restructuring war powers through new joint committees would create constitutional confusion, potentially compromise national security by complicating command structures, and undermine the carefully balanced separation of powers that has guided American war-making for over two centuries. |
