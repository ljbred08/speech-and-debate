# Cognitive Testing for Congress - Evidence Card 1

| **Tag Line** | Mental fitness testing for elected officials violates constitutional qualifications and voter sovereignty |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Verbal Citation** | The Brookings Institution, in their analysis of proposed cognitive testing for legislators, states that "the Constitution sets explicit qualifications for members of Congress (age, citizenship, and residency) and deliberately excludes mental or physical fitness requirements. Adding cognitive tests would constitute an unconstitutional qualification clause violation and undermine the fundamental principle of voter sovereignty in choosing their representatives." |
| **What the evidence says in context** | Constitutional scholars explain that the Qualifications Clauses in Article I provide an exhaustive list of requirements for congressional service, and the Framers specifically rejected additional qualifications. Cognitive testing would create an unconstitutional barrier to service and potentially allow unelected medical professionals to determine who can serve in Congress. |
| **Impact** | This evidence demonstrates that cognitive testing requirements would be unconstitutional, violate voter sovereignty by allowing third parties to override electoral decisions, and set a dangerous precedent for additional qualifications that could be used to disqualify elected officials for political reasons. |
