H.R. 2341, the [Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act](http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_2341.html), would prohibit securities and commodities trading based on nonpublic information relating to Congress, and it would require additional reporting by Members and employees of Congress on their securities transaction.

The motivations behind it are utterly pure. It’s would be unfair for Members of Congress and staff to use inside knowledge of Congress for pecuniary gain.

But how a law like this would be effectively enforced is beyond me. A bar on congressional-insider trading would most likely cause one of the following results:

1.  It would be honored in the breach;
2.  It would lead to endless (perhaps politically motivated) investigations of our representatives and their staffs; or
3.  It would force many or most congressional employees to withdraw from investing as a prophylactic against 2.
