# Evidence Card: Arguments Against Banning Congressional Stock Trading

## Team Policy Evidence Sheet

### Tag Line  
Congressional insider trading bans would create endless investigations and force staff to withdraw from legitimate investing

### Verbal Citation  
Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, in his March 16, 2008 blog post "Sunlight Is the Best Disinfectant" on techliberation.com, argues that H.R. 2341, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, would be problematic because "enforcement would either be ineffective, lead to endless investigations, or cause employees to withdraw from investing as a precaution," warning that such a ban would "cause endless (perhaps politically motivated) investigations of our representatives and their staffs" and "force many or most congressional employees to withdraw from investing as a prophylactic," which would deprive "congressional staff of normal sources of income and of participation in investment that keeps their experience and thinking in line with other Americans."

### What the evidence says in context  
Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, analyzes H.R. 2341, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, arguing that while the motivations behind banning Congressional insider trading are "utterly pure," the enforcement would create significant problems. He identifies three likely outcomes: the ban would be ignored, it would lead to endless politically motivated investigations of representatives and their staffs, or it would force congressional employees to withdraw from investing as a precaution. Harper warns that compliance would deprive congressional staff of normal income sources and investment participation that keeps their experience aligned with other Americans.

### Impact  
Banning Congressional stock trading would either be ineffective through widespread noncompliance, create endless politically motivated investigations that distract from governance, or force congressional staff to abandon legitimate investment activities. Such restrictions would deprive government employees of normal income sources and investment experience while creating constant legal harassment rather than addressing real corruption. The ban would ultimately harm congressional operations and staff financial well-being without providing meaningful investor protection.
